# This script prepares two tidy data sets based on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (Version 1.0) which comprises data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
# The original data set can be obtained at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
# The run_analysis.R script transforms the original data set into two tidy data sets called "data" and "data_avgs" which remain as objects in the enviroment.
# CodeBook.md provides further information about "data" and "data_avgs"
# The run_analysis.R script assumes the orginal data set has been downloaded, extracted and resides in the working directory (in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset").
